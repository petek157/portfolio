                <div class="style-explain">You'll notice that not one of the site versions is styled very well. There is a very good reason for that, I have no style. Seeing something that I like, duplicating it is no problem. But seen as this site is supposed to show what "I" can do, having it look pretty based on someone elses design seems a bit unauthentic.</div>
